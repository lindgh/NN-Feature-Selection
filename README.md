# CS170 Project 2
## Part 1. Implementation of the feature selection algorithm.

In part 1 of this project, we implemented a feature selection program that utilizes either forward selection or backward elimination to determine which set of features produces the highest accuracy. The accuracy evaluation function of a set of features is a stub function that returns a random percentage.

The user enters how many features they wish to explore and whether they want to run forward selection or backward elimination. Then, our program uses a greedy approach to find the best set of features.
